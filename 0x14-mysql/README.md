# Mysql

This project involved learning how to configure database servers in a
primary-replica model. I configured the two servers provided to me by
ALX in a MySQL primary-replica setup with a dummy database, and wrote
a Bash script to automate generation of database backups.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* [4-mysql_configuration_primary](./4-mysql_configuration_primary): The MySQL
`my.conf` configuration file used to set up my first server as a primary database
server on the database `tyrell_corp`.
